# Changelog
## v2.0.2 (2024-11-09)
Bug fix to follow links properly (see this [PR](https://github.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster/pull/64))

Fix for this [issue](https://github.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster/issues/60) (Not being able to redownload epsiodes)

## v2.0.1 (2022-03-03)
- Bug fix release to handle improper timeouts on HTTP requests

## v2.0.0 (2022-02-26)
Shellcaster version 2.0.0 brings many added features and performance improvements, but there are a few breaking changes to the configuration file to be aware of. These are listed below. You can download the default config file from here, to reference when updating your local config: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster/master/config.toml

### New Features
- Switched from *ncurses* C library to Rust-native *crossterm* library for drawing to the terminal. This required a significant rewrite, but drops a significant non-Rust dependency
- Added the ability to toggle "filters" -- to only show played or unplayed episodes (default key: "1" to toggle), or to only show downloaded or non-downloaded episodes (default key: "2" to toggle)
- Details panel can now be scrolled by moving the cursor all the way to the right, and using the same keys to scroll up/down by line or by page

### Performance Improvements
- Added database transactions, which offers a dramatic speed-up when syncing podcasts
- Use of GUIDs when matching against existing episodes, which also speeds up syncing podcasts. **Note:** The first time you do a full sync after updating to v2.0.0, it may take some extra time while the app records the GUIDs of all existing episodes in the database. This is a one-time process, so please be patient!
- Switched to a non-cryptographic hashing algorithm, which offers a minor performance improvement

### Breaking Changes
- The named terminal colors available (e.g., black, blue, cyan) now split off the "dark" versions into separate names. So instead of specifying "blue", you can either specify "blue" or "darkblue". This is a result of switching from *ncurses* to *crossterm*. There are also two additional config options for specifying app colors: `bold_foreground` and `bold_background`, which are used for titles, unplayed episodes, etc. ([see default config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster/master/config.toml))
- There are two extra keybindings listed in the config file, `filter_played` and `filter_downloaded`, which are used to toggle the new filters on and off. By default, they are toggled with the "1" and "2" keys, respectively ([see default config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster/master/config.toml))
- Some of the available crate features have changed: "wide" and "win32" are no longer available (and should no longer be necessary), due to the switch to *crossterm*
- In addition, the HTTP client that shellcaster uses did some significant refactoring, resulting in a few other changes in shellcaster's features as a result. The "rustls" feature has been removed -- the app now uses the *rustls* crate by default. However, you can still choose to use the *native-tls* crate instead by enabling the "native_tls" feature (note that the name has changed from "native-tls" to "native_tls"). In addition, by default *shellcaster* will use your OS's native certificate roots (via the "native_certs" feature), but if you wish to turn this off, you can instead use a bundled copy of the Mozilla Root program by building *shellcaster* with the `--no-default-features` flag

## v1.2.1 (2021-09-08)
- This is a simple patch release to fix a compilation issue resulting from the update to rustc v1.54.0.

## v1.2.0 (2021-05-11)
- Adds new keybindings for scrolling up/down a quarter of the page,
  scrolling a full page up/down, and scrolling to the top or bottom
  (thanks to contributor [a-kenji](https://github.com/a-kenji))
- Adds support for customizable colors
    - This is a backwards-compatible change and does not require any
      modification; however, if you wish to customize the colors after
      upgrading, you will need to [update your config.toml file](https://github.com/jeff-hughes/shellcaster/blob/master/config.toml)
      to add the new options under the "colors" section
- Filenames of downloaded files now include the publication date, which
  reduces potential conflicts with rebroadcasted episodes
- Bug fix:
    - Fixed issue with "removed" episodes reappearing after syncing the
      podcast again
- Some minor performance improvements, particularly when loading the app

## v1.1.0 (2020-12-01)
- Help menu showing the current keybindings (accessible by pressing
  "?" by default)
- New options for downloading new episodes:
    - Can select whether to always download new episodes when syncing
      podcasts, to never download, or to pop up with a window allowing
      you to select which new episodes to download
- Will now ask for confirmation before removing podcasts/episodes
  (thanks to contributor [dougli1sqrd](https://github.com/dougli1sqrd))
- Bug fixes:
    - Border gets redrawn properly when scrolling (thanks to contributor [a-kenji](https://github.com/a-kenji))
    - Messages at the bottom of the screen properly reset cursor
      position, so they always show up on the far left
- Other notes:
    - Added consistent code formatting style with rustfmt (thanks to
      contributor [thunderbiscuit](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit))


## v1.0.1 (2020-08-18)

    - HTML entities (e.g., &amp;amp;) in episode descriptions are now decoded
